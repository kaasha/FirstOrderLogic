# FirstOrderLogic
First Order Logic Operations
Project description
Dr. Ernest Beakerman has been experimenting with gene knockout mice for the last 10 years. Recently he has
had a major breakthrough with his KM-52a strain. It turns out that the mice are hyper intelligent and possess a
keen grasp of logic far superior to any human. Since mice by their nature are quite friendly the KM-52a mice
have employed themselves to bettering humanity. For instance, Algernon II is now advising the president on
foreign matters and has brought the ISIS crisis to a graceful ending and stopped the spread of AIDS in Africa.
The problem with KM-52a is that, like all other mice, they live at most 4 years. As a result, new generations
must be constantly trained to replace the current mice, which die off very quickly. Additionally, they must be
trained with great speed so that they can spend as much time as possible aiding humanity into a new era of
prosperity.
Dr. Beakerman has employed you in his lab to facilitate the training of KM-52a mice. Each mouse will sit in
front of a computer practicing logic exercises. It will be presented with several first-order logic statements. It
will read them and then type in a logical query, which the statements should be able to prove. Your job is to
write a program that will check each conclusion a mouse makes and give it immediate feedback as to whether
the query can be proven. Thus, the mice will learn very quickly via feedback a strong understanding of logic.
To help you develop your system, Dr Beakerman has provided you with several sample knowledge bases the
mice have produced. The knowledge bases contain sentences with the following defined operators:
NOT X ~X
X OR Y X | Y
X AND Y X & Y
X IMPLIES Y X => Y
I have used the resolution inference algorithm, full first-order version (see slide 76 of Monday-Wednesday
slides for session14-15) to solve this problem.
Once you have completed this project Dr. Beakerman will use it to expedite the training of KM-52a mice and
thus usher in a new era of peace and prosperity. After that he will collect his Nobel prize and from then on
forget to ever mention your name when talking about how to train KM-52a mice.
